# Adwords for Alaveteli sites

<p class="lead">
  This is a guide for people who are running Alaveteli sites, and would like to make the best use of Google Adwords to attract more users.
</p>

## Welcome

If you’ve not yet set up your Google Adwords account, you can use this guide as
a step-by-step instruction manual that will get set the foundations for a good
Adwords strategy, and get you up and running.

If you already have a Google Adwords account set up, you may still find it
useful to read through the entire guide, as there are many tips for optimising
your ads.

Throughout this guide, we’ve used examples from mySociety’s own Alaveteli site
in the UK, [WhatDoTheyKnow.com](http://whatdotheyknow.com).

## 1. What are Adwords?

If you use Google, you’ll already be very familiar with Google Ads, the small
text advertisements at the top or to the side of your results:

![Google search bar](/assets/img/adwords-image06.jpg)

![position of ads on search results](/assets/img/adwords-image05.jpg)


A typical Google page contains a few different types of search result:

* **Paid results** (outlined above in turquoise and red): Results which are
  appearing because advertisers paid for them to show when users type in
  specific keywords. The highest-bidder appears on top of the search results;
  the others appear to the side.

* **Google’s helpful information panels**: Often a Wikipedia definition

* **Organic results** (green): Results which appear because they rank highly
  according to Google’s own search algorithm

Adwords is the programme through which you can create and manage Google Ads.

These ads can bring thousands of new visitors to your site. They can ensure
that your site is appearing high in Google’s search result pages, even when it
doesn’t perform well in the organic search.

The basic system for Adwords is simple:

* You tell Google what search terms you want your ad to appear for.
* These search terms are called keywords.
* You tell Google how much you will pay for a click through to your website.
* The more you bid, the higher up your ad appears

In practice, however, several factors make things more complex. We’ll go into
more detail about those later.

## 2. Google Grants

Most businesses and organisations have to pay for Google Ads, but thanks to
Google.org’s philanthropic initiative, charities can apply for a grant that
provides a monthly budget to spend on Ads — for free.

### Where to find out more 

Find out what’s on offer, and apply for your grant, at
[google.com/grants/](https://www.google.com/grants/).

### Eligibility

Not every organisation is eligible for Google Grants.

**They are only available in certain countries** - check eligibility at
[google.com/grants/eligibility](https://www.google.com/grants/eligibility).

Google regularly adds more countries to the scheme, so if your country isn’t
covered yet, do go back and check every couple of months. Or follow the Google
for Non-Profits blog at
[googlefornonprofits.blogspot.co.uk](http://googlefornonprofits.blogspot.co.uk/)
to keep up with the latest announcements.

**Your organisation must have charity status** — and be able to prove it. In
the UK, this means having a ‘registered charity’ number, but the means by which
you prove charity status is different from country to country.
[Check the details here](https://support.google.com/nonprofits/answer/3215869?hl=en&ref_topic=3247288).

### What does a Google Grant give you?

You’ll start off with **$10,000 credit** (in US Dollars) to spend on
advertising per month.

Once that is up and running, you can apply for the higher tier of **$40,000 per
month**, if you meet certain criteria.

You can spend your budget on **text ads only** (not other formats of ads, for
example those with videos or images), and only ads which appear on Google
search pages (not their network which places ads on other participating sites).

Currently you can only bid a maximum of **$2 on each keyword**.

## 3.  Planning your Adwords

Once you’ve been accepted on the grant, you can go and set up your ads. But
before you do so, it’s a good idea to think your campaigns through. A little
groundwork now will make the setting up and maintenance of your ads a lot
easier.

### What do you want to achieve?

Of course, Google Ads will bring more visitors to your site - that might seem
like a good aim in itself, but there’s no point in indiscriminately attracting
all kinds of people who won’t be interested in what you have to offer.

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    Ask yourself:
    <br>
    <strong>Who do I want to attract to the site?</strong>
    <br>
    Your answers might be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>People who want to make an FOI request</li>
    <li>Journalists who want to research a story</li>
    <li>People who will benefit from reading the responses to existing FOI requests</li>
    <li>People who don’t know what FOI is, but might make a request if they did know</li>
    <li>People who don’t know what FOI is, but will benefit from reading some of the responses on the site</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ...or it might be all of the above. That’s fine too.
  </p>
</div>

It’s very useful to define each group of people and their needs. It means that
when we are deciding on:

* keywords to bid on
* the text of the ads that we create
* the pages that users will land on
* the goals we want to achieve

we can make each of them as relevant as possible for each group.

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    Now ask yourself the next question:
    <br>
    <strong>What do I want these people to do when they come to the site?</strong>
    <br>
    Possible answers might be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make an FOI request</li>
    <li>Find out what services we offer to journalists</li>
    <li>Read existing FOI requests</li>
    <li>Read existing FOI requests and then go on to make their own</li>
    <li>Learn about their rights under the FOI act and then go on to make a request</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ...or perhaps you’ll have your own answers, according to the background of
    your project, your knowledge of its users, etc. That’s fine, so long as you
    have some clearly-defined groups and actions.
  </p>
</div>

### What keywords do you need?

When you set up your Adwords, you’ll tell Google which searches you want your
ads to display for.

The best way to decide on these keywords is to ask yourself, for each of the
groups of people you have defined above, ‘if I were one of these people, what
would I type into Google to answer my need?’.

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    Start a spreadsheet or
    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1evaPjXHJmm75iosiF4sX5qrBdWPP2IyKnA5g2MtTaOc/edit#gid=0">use our template</a>.
    Use a different tab for each of the groups of people you identified above.
  </p>
</div>

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image30.jpg" alt="spreadsheet layout" class="with-border" />

Now we’re going to fill it with keywords.

### Methods for finding keywords

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    As a first step, make a list of 10&ndash;20 search terms for each type of
    person. Add these to your spreadsheet, on the relevant tabs for each type
    of user.
  </p>
</div>

Some will be easier than others. People who want to make an FOI request, for
example, are likely to use keywords such as:

* *Make an FOI request*
* *How do I make an FOI request?*
* *FOI request template*
* *Make a Freedom of Information request*
* *Make FOI request UK*

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image27.jpg" alt="spreadsheet example" class="with-border"/>
 
‘People who don’t know what FOI is’ might search for:

* *What is FOI?*
* *What is Freedom of Information*
* *Freedom of Information Act 2000*
* *Information about FOI*

Note that everyone has their own way of searching, so there are many variables
for every search term. You can even include common spelling mistakes.

‘People who will benefit from browsing FOI requests’ are a harder group to pin
down. You could use your knowledge of your own site - for example, if there are
many responses from the Ministry of Defence, you could list keywords such as:

* Information about the Ministry of Defence
* Ministry of Defence budget
* Ministry of Defence statistics

Be careful as you pick your keywords, though. The best Google Ads meet the need
of the user.

For example:

* A user types in ‘Make a freedom of information request’. An ad displays with
  the text *‘WhatDoTheyKnow.com helps you make a freedom of information
  request — quickly, easily and for free’*. This is a good match to the user’s
  need.
* A user types in ‘information about California’. An ad displays with the text
  *‘WhatDoTheyKnow.com helps you make a freedom of information request —
  quickly, easily and for free’*. This is probably a poor match to most users’
  needs.
* A user types in ‘freedom of information’. It’s hard to know exactly what that
  user needs — information about FOI? An ad displays with the text
  *‘WhatDoTheyKnow.com: make or browse freedom of information requests, or find
  out more about FOI’*. This is the best guess we can make at a match to the
  user’s need.
* A user types in ‘freedom of information’. An ad displays with the text
  *‘WhatDoTheyKnow.com helps you make a freedom of information request —
  quickly, easily and for free’*. This may be a good match to some users’
  needs, but not others.

OK: got 10&ndash;20 good keywords for each type of user?

<div class="attention-box helpful-hint">
  <p>
    <strong>If you are new to Adwords</strong>, you have enough keywords to set
    up a new account, and you can come back to look at the other methods for
    finding keywords later, once your account is up and running.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>If you’re looking for more ways to generate keywords</strong>,
    we’ve detailed those in section 6.
  </p>
</div>

### Landing pages

Now that you’ve collected a good list of keywords, it’s time to think about
where your ads will be sending people. ‘Landing page’ means the page they first
see when they arrive at your site.

All your ads will link to your website — but you don’t necessarily have to send
people to the homepage.

The group of keywords for ‘people who want to know what FOI is’ could be
pointed towards an FAQs page, while for ‘people who want to make an FOI
request’ the homepage probably is the best destination.

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    As you decide on the best landing page for each keyword, add the urls
    beside them, on your spreadsheet.
  </p>
</div>

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image39.jpg" class="with-border" alt="landing page spreadsheet" />

### Plan your Ad Groups

If you’ve followed the action points above, you should now have a spreadsheet
which:

* Groups keywords by the user need that they represent
* Indicates which URL each keyword’s ad should link to

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image37.jpg" class="with-border" alt="keyword to URL spreadsheet" />

In a moment, you are going to go into your Adwords account and create an Ad
Group for each specific user need.

Think of an Ad Group as being like a folder on your computer. Inside the folder
are:

* A set of keywords which reflect the same user need
* The bids attached to each of those keywords, ie the maximum you will pay for
  a click through to your site
* The ads which those keywords will trigger, which in turn contain:
   * The URL of the landing pages that your ads will link to

An Ad Group may contain any number of Ads and any number of keywords. It will
be easier to stay organised if you keep your Ad Groups to a single theme/user
need. Google will also reward you for this behaviour (by displaying your ads
more often or more prominently), because it will result in ads which are highly
specific to the users’ searches.

Let’s look at our keywords around making an FOI request.

* Make an FOI request
* How do I make an FOI request?
* FOI request template
* Make a Freedom of Information request
* Make FOI request UK

These keywords are all different, but all reflect the same user need, so we can
put them all into one Ad Group and name it “Making a request”.

<div class="attention-box helpful-hint">
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: In fact, if you want to be very organised, you might
    create separate Ad Groups for each of:
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>FOI request template</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    and:
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>How do I make an FOI request?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    Then you would be able to create the ads in these Ad Groups so that they
    mention the words ‘templates’ or ‘how to’, and you might even link to
    tailored landing pages (as described in the ‘Advanced’ section of this
    document).
  </p>
</div>

When you write your ads, the more you can use the same language as your user,
the more successful they will be.

![example ad](/assets/img/adwords-image14.jpg)

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    Look at the keywords on your spreadsheet, and divide them into Ad Groups so
    that each group reflects exactly the same need — or the exact same
    vocabulary.
  </p>
</div>

In some cases, you will have already done this via your tabs, but as you can
see above, there is potential for further refinement.

So for example, our ‘make an FOI request’ tab can now be divided into several
concept groups, like this:

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image38.jpg" class="with-border" alt="concept groups in spreadsheet" />

Each concept will form one Ad Group.

## 4. Setting up Adwords

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    Let’s log in to our Adwords account at 
    <a href="https://www.google.com/adwords/">adwords.google.com</a>
    and start setting those Ad Groups up.
  </p>
</div>

Google Ads are effectively organised in a nested folder structure. The top
level is your **account**. That contains everything you set up within Adwords.

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image02.jpg" class="with-border" alt="Accounts screenshot" />

Within the account, you have one or more **campaigns** (mySociety, which runs
several websites, has one campaign per website, but if you are only setting up
Adwords for one site, you will only have one campaign). This is what our
campaigns list looks like:

![All campaigns](/assets/img/adwords-image11.jpg)

Within your campaign are your **Ad Groups**: each one representing a single
topic or theme, just as we prepared them in the previous step. This is some of
WhatDoTheyKnow’s list of Ad Groups:

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image04.jpg" class="with-border" alt="example Ad groups" />

And within each Adgroup there are **keywords** and **ads**, which are
co-dependent (the ads are triggered by the keywords, and the wording of the ads
should reflect the keywords as closely as possible).

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image08.jpg" class="with-border" alt="keywords screenshot" style="margin-right:1em"/>
<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image10.jpg" class="with-border" alt="ads screenshot" />

Thanks to all the action points we went through above, you have all the
information you need to start setting up your Adwords account.

<div class="attention-box helpful-hint">
  <p>
    If you have already set up your account, skip this part and go to the next
    section, <a href="#building-adwords">Building Adwords</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    Go to <a href="https://adwords.google.com">https://adwords.google.com</a>
    and click on ‘Start Now’
  </p>
</div>

Use the email address under which you applied for your Google Grant, and input
the URL of your Alaveteli website.

### Set up a campaign

Each campaign contains Ad Groups for a single website. An account can contain
any number of campaigns, but if your account is funded by a Google Grant, any
website you promote must have been accepted on the scheme.

If you have received the grant for a single site, you will only have one
campaign. You can give it the same name as your Alaveteli site.

<div class="attention-box helpful-hint">
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: Settings that you input now will affect your entire
    campaign — but you’ll have a chance to tweak them later. You can access
    settings via the ‘Settings’ tab on any Ad Group or Campaign page. So don’t
    worry too much; nothing is set in stone.
  </p>
</div>

<strong>Budget</strong>: Your budget is dictated by the grant: with $10,000 per
month, your daily budget is around $333.00. Even though Google decides this
figure, you still need to put it in!

Don’t worry about the section asking for your credit card details. You are
seeing the same page as paying customers. Choose to skip the section where it
asks for your credit card details. Payment will be taken care of by Google.

<strong>Bid strategy</strong>: This allows you to decide whether you want to
pay per 1,000 impressions (times your ad is displayed) or per click. We
recommend per-click (CPC) as it is more results-based.

<strong>Geographical reach and language of your ads</strong>: Does it make
sense to target only people who live in your own country? Only people who speak
the language/s that your site uses? There is more information about language
targeting here:
[https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/1722078?ctx=tltp&authuser=0](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/1722078?ctx=tltp&authuser=0)

<div class="attention-box helpful-hint">
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: Later, you may wish to change these settings for
    each of your Ad Groups: for example, if you have more than one language on
    your site, it would make sense to make an Ad Group for each language, and
    set the geographic reach or language targets differently for each. But for
    now, don’t worry - pick one for the purposes of account set-up.
  </p>
</div>

<strong>Types of ad and the networks where they will be shown</strong>: The
grant only allows you to create text ads, and to display them on Google search,
so even though you will see options such as video ads and displaying on
partners’ websites, ignore them.

<strong>Devices</strong>: Do you wish your ads to appear on mobile, tablets, or
all devices? Unless you have a good reason, we recommend showing your ads on
every type of device.

You have now filled in enough information to start creating your ads.

## 5. Building Adwords

Let's build your first Ad Group.

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    Select the ‘Ad Groups’ tab and click on the red
    <strong>+&nbsp;Ad&nbsp;Group</strong> button.
  </p>  
</div>

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image29.jpg" class="with-border" alt="WDTK screenshot" />

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image12.jpg" class="with-border" alt="ad groups screenshot" />

Choose a name for your Ad Group that reflects its topic or concept.

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image25.jpg" class="with-border" alt="Name this ad group screenshot" />

Now you are going to write your Ad. This is quite an art, because you can only
use a limited number of characters per line. You are trying to be eye-catching,
inviting and comprehensible, and all within just a few lines.

You also want to reflect your keywords — the user’s vocabulary — as much as
possible. Ideally, you’ll also include a call to action.

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image03.jpg" class="with-border" alt="Create an ad screenshot" />

However, in practice, it’s often hard to meet all of these criteria within such
a limited character count, so just keep trying until your ad is the best you
can make it.

**Display URL**: This is the web address that will appear in your ad: keep it
nice and simple - it really just acts as an indicator to the user of which site
they will be going to.

**Final URL**: This is the web address that you want your user to actually land
on - the one you have already noted in your spreadsheet. It may be an inner
page of your site with a very long URL, but that doesn’t matter: the user will
only see the Display URL.

<div class="attention-box helpful-hint">
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: You can have different URLs for each keyword, which
    can be useful in certain circumstances. See the Advanced section at the end
    of this guide for more details.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    Next you are going to add the keywords that you listed earlier. 
  </p>
</div>

In the right-hand box, you’ll see that Google has already generated some
suggested keywords, from the text of your ad and from the page that it is
pointing towards:

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image31.jpg" class="with-border" alt="suggested keywords screenshot" />

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    If there are keywords that suit your Ad Group, click ‘add’ — but remember
    the theme of your Ad Group and be strict about only adding search words
    which relate to it. You can always use these suggestions later, to set up a
    new Ad Group.
  </p>
  <p>
    Paste your own keywords into the box on the left.
  </p>
</div>

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image20.jpg" class="with-border" alt="adding keywords screenshot" />

And then choose how much you are going to bid.

### Bids

<div class="attention-box helpful-hint">
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: It’s worth remembering at this point that you are
    not paying ‘real’ money: your Google Grant covers all costs. However, you
    will still see the same options that paying users do, for example, for
    adding your credit card details, so it’s easy to worry that your ads are
    not free after all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don’t sweat, you won’t get a bill at the end of the month!
  </p>
</div>

A bid is the maximum amount that you are prepared to ‘pay’ for a click through
to your website. If no-one clicks on your ads, there’s nothing to pay.

You can also set a bid ceiling, so your ad stops displaying when you have
reached the limit of how much you want to spend per day. You can set your upper
limits by clicking on the figures in the ‘Budget’ column in the Campaigns tab.

Bids are made in US currency, no matter which country you are in.

Your Google Grant only allows you to bid up to $2.00 per keyword. Starting off
with a bid of $1 is a good start: you can always tweak your bids later.

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    Enter your $1 bid and click ‘save ad group’. This is your default bid. You
    will have a chance to increase or decrease the bid for individual keywords
    later, should you wish.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="attention-box helpful-hint">
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>:
    For most Freedom-of-Information-related keywords, $2 per keyword is plenty.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, you may find that, for some popular keywords, $2 is not enough to
    compete with paying advertisers (who, of course, have no upper limit on how
    much they can pay for bids).
  </p>
  <p>
    Don’t despair, though - you can still bid. Your ad may appear on the second
    page of search results, where it will be seen by far fewer people. But
    remember that at any one time, you are only seeing a snapshot of the
    Adwords ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>
    When other advertisers hit their budget ceiling (which may happen at a
    certain hour of each day), or pause their campaigns for any reason (which
    can happen at any time), your ads may have a chance of being displayed on
    the first page again.
  </p>
</div>  

Well done! You’ve made your first Ad Group. 

You’ll be taken to a table showing your keywords. This is where, in future
weeks, you will be able to return and see how your ads and keywords are
performing.

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image13.png" class="with-border" alt="table of keywords screenshot" />

Let’s take a quick look at this table. 

Some of our keywords are showing the status **Below first page bid**. Remember
that this just refers to the position right now: tomorrow, or the day after, my
bid may well be enough to be on the first page. But for now, I might want to
increase my bid.

The message tells me that for a first-page position I need to bid $1.91. Just
click on the figure in the ‘Max CPC’ (Cost Per Click) column and you’ll be able
to edit it.

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image18.png" class="with-border" alt="edit cost per click screenshot" />
 
Other keywords are displaying the message **Low search volume**. That’s fine —
it just means that not many people search for that term. Those keywords aren’t
doing any harm though, so you can leave them there and keep an eye on how well
they perform over the next few months. You can always delete them if they turn
out not to bring you any users.

You may see other messages here. This is where you will be informed if any of
your keywords have been disallowed, or if there’s any other sort of problem.

Clicking on the little speech bubble beside each word will give you more
information about their status. Right now, all our keywords are ‘pending’: ads
won’t display until they have been approved by Google, which may take a couple
of days.

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image33.png" class="with-border" alt="pending review screenshot" />

<div class="attention-box info">
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: You can have any number of ads in your Ad Group. At
    first, Google will display all of them on rotation, for an equal amount of
    searches. Once it has enough information, it will begin to favour those ads
    which have performed the best (ie, have attracted the most clicks).
  </p>
  <p>
    So it is a good idea to make 3 or 4 ads for each Ad Group, and check back
    on a regular basis to learn more about which ads are working best. Then you
    can use similar wording and formats in your other ads.
  </p>
</div>

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image36.jpg" class="with-border" alt="ad table screenshot" />

As you can see in the image above, Google has displayed the middle ad many more
times than the other two - you can see this both from the ‘% served’ column and
the ‘clicks’ column.

This might be because it uses the word ‘template’ - perhaps that closely
matches most users’ searches, or is easier for them to understand than the
concept of a ‘sample request’ or a ‘request form’.

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    Click on the ‘Ads’ tab, click the red 
    <strong>+&nbsp;Ad</strong> button, and add two more ads to your Ad Group.
  </p>
</div>

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image42.png" class="with-border" alt="ad group form letter screenshot" />

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    Great! Your first Ad Group is up and running. Now go back to
    <a href="#setting-up-adwords">step 4, Setting up Adwords</a>
    and repeat the process until you have an Ad Group for each of your
    themes/user needs.
  </p>
</div>

### Why all this preparation?

You might be thinking ‘well, that was a lot of bother, before I even got to
create my Adwords. Why can’t I just dive straight in and start setting up ads
for the obvious keywords?’.

But with this method, there’s a much higher chance of success. Put yourself in
the user’s position.

* You type in ‘Freedom of Information request template’.

* You see an ad which says ‘use our template to create a Freedom of Information
  request’.
  <br>
  ‘Great!’ you think — ‘That’s exactly what I need!’
  <br>
  (If the ad had been more generic, eg ‘Make and browse Freedom of Information
  requests’, you would have to do a little work to understand that it is
  relevant to your needs).

* You click through, possibly to a landing page made specially, titled ‘Freedom
  of Information request template’. This explains that you will be taken to a
  page where you can create your request, and adds any other details you need
  to know.

* You click through to the ‘make a request’ page on the Alaveteli site.

It’s a highly satisfying user experience, and that’s why Google also rewards
this kind of approach by giving your ads a higher quality score, resulting in
higher or more consistent placing.

## 6. Maintaining your account

One of the conditions of your Google Grant is that you will log in at a minimum
of once a fortnight to maintain your account.

**You are at risk of losing your grant if you don’t fulfil this condition**. We
recommend setting a calendar alert to help you remember to visit at least once
a fortnight.

In any case, it’s a good idea to keep a regular eye on your ads. Here are some
things you can do in a regular half-hour visit:

* Check for keywords you’ve been outbid on, and raise your bid if possible
* Check which ads are performing best, and replicate their wording across your
  other ad groups
* Learn how many clicks your ads are sending to your site, and see if you can
  increase that number by refining your ads, adding keywords, or tweaking
  settings
* Consider pausing or deleting keywords and ads which aren’t performing well.
  In theory, they won’t do you any harm, but in practice, as you get more ads
  set up, they will add to the unwieldiness of your account, and will also
  affect statistics such as your account-wide ‘click through rate’ (which, in
  turn, may affect your eligibility for the grant).
* Use some of the keyword-generating tips below to create new ad groups or add
  to the ones you already have.
* Click ‘Details’ and ‘All’ above your keywords table to show the actual search
  terms people have typed in before clicking on your ads:

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image21.png" class="with-border" alt="auction insights screenshot" />

You’ll then be given the option of adding these keywords to your list — or
marking them as ‘negative keywords’ if they’re not a good fit for your site
(see below for more information about negative keywords).

### Understanding your account’s performance

There are several tabs, buttons and options in the Adwords interface, but you
are likely to use some of them more often than the others.

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image43.jpg" class="with-border" alt="adtabs buttons and options screenshot" />

**From any tab**: Click the
<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image34.jpg" style="vertical-align: middle" alt="graph button"/>
button to see your data displayed as a graph. The graph is useful because it
gives you an immediate view of how your Adwords are performing — are there any
big dips? Peaks? These may be indications that you need to dig deeper to find
out why.

Once it displays, you can change the metric the graph shows, via the drop down
top left:

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image19.png" class="with-border" alt="graph options screenshot" />

Let’s take a look at some of those options, because they also head up the
columns in your table.

**Clicks** How many people have actually clicked on your ad to be taken through
to your site?
<br>
**Impr** Short for ‘impressions’: how many times has your ad been shown?
<br>
**CTR** Stands for ‘Click through rate’. This is a percentage, arrived at by
dividing the number of clicks by the number of impressions. Higher is better
(but be prepared to lower your expectations: a CTR of 2% is considered decent,
and anything higher is fantastic).
<br>
**Avg. CPC** The average cost per click, calculated by adding up every click
and how much it cost you, then dividing by the number of clicks.
<br>
**Avg. CPM** The average cost for every thousand impressions. Cost How much you
spent each day.
<br>
**Avg Pos** The average position where your ad was displayed - lower is better,
1 is best.

**Ad Groups, Ads and Keywords tabs**

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image41.jpg" class="with-border" alt="ad groups screenshot" />

Use the Ad Groups, Ads and Keywords tabs to see which of your Ad Groups, ads or
keywords are performing best.

Clicking on each column header will sort the table by that column.

**Green dots** The green dot indicates that your Ad Group, ad or keyword is
active. If you’d like to pause or remove an entry, you can do it from here.

**Status** This is where you will see if there are any problems with a specific
ad or keyword, eg if it has been disallowed. Don’t worry - ads are usually
disallowed for minor reasons such as a typo in the URL, so all you have to do
is correct them and they’ll be reassessed.

**Default max CPC** Indicates the maximum price you will pay for keywords in
each Ad Group. If you do not set a bid for an individual keyword, it will
default to this amount. You can click on the number to change it.

**Clicks, Impressions, CTR, Avg, CPC** As described before. Each of these
metrics is important in its own way, so you should consider them in combination.

Sort by **clicks** to see which Ad Groups, keywords or ads have been clicked on
by the most people. Does that mean they’re the most successful?

Maybe not, because other ads may have been displayed fewer times, but have a
higher **click through rate**, ie a higher percentage of people who saw that ad
have clicked on it.

Conversely, an ad may attract hundreds of clicks, but in the context of having
had its ads displayed many thousands of times - it then has a poor click
through rate despite its high number of clicks.

Google seems to set most store on the click through rate, so it’s a good one to
keep an eye on.

**Cost** We are fortunate, as grant recipients, that we do not have to worry
too much about cost, but you can tweak the individual spends for each ad, Ad
Group or keyword, and this will help you promote the ones which you believe are
most useful to your aims.

**Conversions** These columns will only be relevant if you have set up
conversion tracking and registered a goal on your website, eg ‘making a
request’ or ‘subscribing to an authority’.

The full details of setting up Conversions is beyond the scope of this guide,
though. If you want to know more, see Google’s
[support pages on this topic](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/1722054).

## 7. Advanced Google Ads

If you’ve followed all the advice above, you have a good foundation for your
Adwords account. Let it run for a few weeks, then come back and read through
the advice below.

### Other methods for finding keywords

Once your Adwords are up and running, you might want to add more keywords.
Doing so will increase the number of opportunities for your ads to be
displayed, so it makes sense to input as many high-quality, relevant terms as
you can.

Here are some more sources of good keywords.

#### The content of your site

Every Alaveteli site contains a variety of page-types:

* Bodies’ pages
* Request pages - including a subset of the most-viewed requests
* FAQs or information about FOI

Each of these may suggest keywords. For example:

* A body such as the Scottish Police Authority might suggest keywords such as:
  *FOI Scottish Police Authority*; *FOI SPA*; *Freedom of Information Scottish
  Police Authority*; *Freedom of Information SPA*...

And looking at the requests for that authority might give you more ideas, for
example: *Scottish Police Authority tribunals*, *Scottish Police Authority
complaints*, *Scottish Police Authority staffing*, *Scottish Police Authority
salaries*, etc.

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    As you generate new keywords, add them to your spreadsheet. 
  </p>
  <p>
    You may be creating several new tabs as you discover several new types of
    user need - ‘people who want to know more about a specific authority’, for
    example.
  </p>
</div>

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image40.jpg" class="with-border" alt="spreadhseet screenshot" />

#### Your most popular requests

Using an analytics programme to discover what are the most common *types* of
request, or which *individual requests* are the most viewed, will provide more
ideas.

If you use Google Analytics, you can do this by going to Behaviour>Site
Content>All Pages in the left-hand column.

Use the search box above the table (on the right) to filter the results so that
you only see those containing /request/:

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image35.jpg" class="with-border" alt="search /request/ screenshot" />

This will show you which requests are the most-viewed on your site, for
whatever timeframe you are assessing:

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image28.jpg" class="with-border" alt="most-viewed screenshot" />

If you’re not sure which requests these are, click on the little
<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image01.jpg" style="vertical-align: middle" alt="external link button"/>
 sign and the relevant page of your site will open up in a new window.

These requests are likely to be the ones which are providing information that
is useful to a great number of people, so you may wish to promote them further
with Ads. Some keywords that our list suggests might include:

* *Benefits for immigrants*
* *Processing time for residence cards*
* *Do I have to pay council tax*
* *How long is ILR valid*

and you might also consider variants of these, such as:

* *Entitlements for immigrants*
* *state benefits for immigrants*
* *what can immigrants receive*
* *is council tax mandatory*
* *exceptions to council tax*
* *definition of ILR*
* *How long is Indefinite Leave to Remain valid*

etc, etc

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    Group all these on a new tab on your spreadsheet, too.
  </p>
</div>

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image09.jpg" class="with-border" alt="spredsheet screenshot" />

#### Organic search terms

Your Analytics program can also tell you which organic search terms people used
to find your site.

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    In Google Analytics, you can visit Acquisition>Search Engine Optimisation>
    Keywords to see the phrases that people are typing in before visiting your
    site.
  </p>
</div>

* although, unfortunately, Google’s new privacy rules mean that they are
  providing less and less information on this - as you can see in the image
  below. ‘Not set’ are the search terms which have not been recorded, in this
  case, over 75% of them).

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image00.jpg" class="with-border" alt="organic search screenshot" />

Of course, there is an inherent issue here: these keywords are already bringing
people to your site through organic search, so why show adverts to people
searching for those terms?

There are two answers to that:

* Displaying ads for these terms increases the chances that people will notice
  your site in the search results, whether they are looking at ads or organic
  search;

* Inputting these terms will give Google a foundation on which to base its
  suggested keywords (see more about that below).

Looking at these keywords may prompt you to add new tabs to your spreadsheet,
as you discover new user needs. Let’s go through some of the keywords above:

* *what do they know* (and variants): people who know about the site and want
  to visit it

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image23.jpg" class="with-border" alt="site name spredsheet screenshot" />

* *p45* (in the UK this is a document you are given when you leave a job): It’s
  probable that there is a useful response on the site which is helping people
  who need information about this term - and indeed,
  [this page](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/107338/response/266697/attach/html/3/1380%20Attree.pdf.html)
  is the 4th Google result for the term.

* *ukba* (The UK Border Agency is one of the bodies on WhatDoTheyKnow): The
  most likely reason for typing this in is that people want to find the UKBA’s
  own website, but
  [this page](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/body/ukba)
  appears as the 5th result in Google.

* freedom of information act: We can add this term to ‘people who want to know
  more about FOI’

...and so on.

#### Use Google’s suggestions

When you input your keywords into your Google Adwords account, you’ll have seen
that Google also suggests more keywords you could use. These are based on the
keywords you have already added, on the wording of your ads, and on the content
of your landing page.

But you can also access this function without actually building new ads, via
[adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner](https://adwords.google.com/KeywordPlanner) 
or through the ‘tools’ menu at the top of your Adwords page.

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image24.jpg" class="with-border" alt="keyword planner screenshot" />

Typing in the phrase ‘freedom of information’ and WhatDoTheyKnow’s homepage
gives these suggestions:

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image07.jpg" class="with-border" alt="keyword (by relevance) screenshot" />

Use your common sense when deciding which of Google’s keyword suggestions to
use. For example, in the list above, ‘work and pensions’ is appearing because
the Department for Work and Pensions, one of the authorities covered by
WhatDoTheyKnow, is appearing in the list of recent responses on the homepage.

‘Work and pensions’ on its own is not a particularly good keyword, although it
might give you ideas for other, better ones such as ‘information from the dept
of work and pensions’.

Also be aware that Google’s data about the popularity of searches, etc, comes
from its US users, so spellings and choices of words are not always directly
applicable.

As an example, the acronym FOIA is much more common in the US than it is in the
UK, yet it is being suggested despite the fact that we chose the UK as our
target area.

### Keyword types

When you click on a keyword, you’ll be given the option to designate it as a
**Broad Match**, **Exact Match** or **Phrase Match**.

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image26.png" class="with-border" alt="screenshot" />

You can
[read more about match types here](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2497836).

### Bulk uploads

If you want to upload large numbers of keywords at one time, or you want to do
something a little more complex such as link to different URLs from within one
Ad group, you can use Bulk Upload.

This allows you to prepare your keywords, ad text, bids and landing pages on a
spreadsheet, and then upload them all together.

You can also download your keywords, make your required changes, and re-upload
the spreadsheet.

See [this help page](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2477116) for
more information.

### Keyword insertion

Keyword insertion allows you to create a single Ad Group which refers to many
different topics. For example, if you take your ten most-viewed reports, you
could create a list of keywords which refer to them:

benefits <br>
welfare <br>
ID cards <br>
defence spending <br>
council tax <br>
indefinite leave to remain <br>
ILR
Passat brakes <br>
UK postcodes <br>
UKBA

And then write one ad like this:

**FOI requests about {Keyword: everything}** <br>
Browse Freedom of Information <br>
requests on {Keyword: many topics}.

This set-up means that if a user types in one of the keywords listed above, if
possible it will appear in the ad, in place of the content within the curly
brackets. So the user could see, for example:

**FOI requests about welfare** <br>
Browse Freedom of Information <br>
requests on welfare.

On the other hand, if the keyword is too long to fit within the character
limit, they will see the word inside the curly brackets instead. So ‘Indefinite
Leave to remain’ would display an ad like this:

**FOI requests about everything** <br>
Browse Freedom of Information <br>
requests on many topics.

Either way, the ad makes sense. You can read
[more about this method](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2454041).

### Negative keywords

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image21.png" class="with-border" alt="keyword details screenshot" />

When you check which keywords have brought users to your site (by clicking
**Details** and **All** above the keywords table), you may find that there are
some undesirable keywords.

For example, on our website about the UK Parliament, while we are a great fit
for people searching for **MPs** (Members of Parliament), we don’t have
anything for people looking for **MP3s**.

You can add negative keywords to your keyword list — and apply them to just one
Ad Group or across all Ad groups. This tells Google not to deliver your ads for
those terms. Just click on ‘negative keywords’ above the keywords table.

![negative keywords screenshot](/assets/img/adwords-image22.png)

And then click the red **+&nbsp;Keywords** button to list your undesirables.

### More sophisticated landing pages

For some of your keywords, it might be that clicking through to the relevant
page of your site would actually be quite a confusing experience for the user.

For example, setting up Adwords for WhatDoTheyKnow, with a keyword that refers
to the Scottish Police Authority, you’d probably choose to have
[www.whatdotheyknow.com/body/scottish_police_authority](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/body/scottish_police_authority)
as your landing page:

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image32.jpg" class="with-border" alt="SPA landing page" />

But for a user who isn’t familiar with WhatDoTheyKnow.com, there isn’t very
much context to explain what the site is or how it can be used.

Some users will take one look at this page, decide it’s too difficult to
understand, and click the ‘back’ button.

In cases like this, you may decide that it is worth creating specially-crafted
landing pages. If you have some developer skills, you can add these to your
Alaveteli site with custom routes, actions and templates.

Here’s a landing page that we set up for one of mySociety’s other sites,
TheyWorkForYou.com, which monitors the UK parliament:

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image16.jpg" class="with-border" alt="Parliament landing page" />

Although they take extra effort, landing pages like these have a few benefits:

* You can set the context for the user, allowing you to ‘hold their hand’ and show them the path to the action they want to take;

* You can mirror the user’s search term precisely, so they are more likely to perceive the landing page as highly relevant to their needs - in fact, you could set up several almost identical pages, one for each variation on search terms;

By reflecting the search term in this way, you’ll also find that Google
‘rewards’ you for having relevant content, by displaying your ad higher in its
rankings more consistently.

### Beyond the landing page

<div class="attention-box info">
  <h4>Action</h4>
  <p>
    Give a little thought as to where users will go after they visit the landing page.
  </p>
</div>

If you are pointing your ad directly at a page on your Alaveteli website,
hopefully it will be very clear what the user should do next, and there is no
need to worry any further.

If you are linking to a specially-crafted landing page, you still need to link
from there to a relevant page on your Alaveteli site, once you have set the
scene for the user.

Will it be the homepage? Or perhaps you’ll include a search box on the landing
page which the user can fill in, and be taken directly to the search results on
your page. Whatever you decide, the important thing is to make sure you’re
offering the best, and clearest, experience to your user.

### What will affect your ad’s placement?

Early on in this guide, we mentioned that Google Ads’ system is a little more
sophisticated than it might at first seem. There are several factors which
affect where your ad appears on a search results page.

### Google’s assessment of how relevant your ad is 

If your landing page bears no relation to the wording of your ad, or the
keywords you’ve attached to it, you are likely to have your ad either
disapproved, or given a low quality score, effectively meaning that it will
rarely or never be displayed.

That’s why the system detailed above is a good one: it ensures that ads,
keywords and landing pages all have the same theme.

You can check the quality score for any ad or keyword by clicking on the speech
bubble beside them:

<img src="/assets/img/adwords-image17.png" class="with-border" alt="quality score screenshot" />

### Your upper budget

You have two budgets which affect your ads’ positioning: your campaign budget,
and the amount your bid for each keyword.

Both are constrained by the conditions of the Google Grant. 

**Your daily campaign budget** is the monthly grant ($10,000 or $40,000
depending which tier you are on) divided by 30, for the average number of days
in a month, so $333 or $1333.

When you hit this limit — ie, when enough people have clicked your ads that you
have been ‘charged’ this daily amount, your ads will stop displaying until the
next day.

If you have more than one campaign, you can set the budget for each of them,
which gives you a little flexibility to favour one or the other.

Your **keyword bids** are, of course, constrained by the $2 upper limit, so
once you have hit that ceiling, if your keyword is hotly contested, other
people’s ads will appear above it — until they hit their own daily budget
limits, when your ad will once again have a chance to shine.

### Tailored search results

Anyone with a Gmail account, YouTube account, Google Calendar, or accounts with
any of the many other services offered by Google may well be logged in when
they make a search. Unless they have changed their privacy settings, Google
will use the knowledge they have about users to ensure that results are more
relevant. So for example, when you search for ‘coffee shop’, Google might show
you ads from local coffee shops first.

### Applying for the higher-tier Google Grant

Once your basic Adwords account has been up and running for a minimum of six
months, you may want to apply for the higher level of grant, known as
GrantsPro. Full details of this are
[here on support.google.com/grants](https://support.google.com/grants/answer/6022748)

To apply for GrantsPro you must fulfil several requirements, including having
met your existing budget cap for two out of the last six months, having
[conversion tracking](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/1722054) in
place, and upholding an average CTR (click-through rate) of 1% or more (this is
an example of why deleting or pausing poorly-performing ads and keywords may be
beneficial to your overall standing).

You’ll also have to fill in a form in which you quantify, as far as possible,
the tangible benefits that Adwords have brought you. If you can indicate real
world outcomes, you’ll stand a better chance of being accepted on the scheme.

<div class="attention-box info">
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: Competition is high for the GrantsPro grants, and if
    you don’t fulfil all their requirements, you’ll be turned down — with an
    invitation to try again when you do meet requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s worth remembering to screen-cap or copy and paste your application
    before you send it in, because Google do not send you a copy of it.
    Otherwise, when you submit a follow-up application, you’ll be starting
    again from scratch.
  </p>
</div>
